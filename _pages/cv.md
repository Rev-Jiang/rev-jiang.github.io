Work experience
======
- *Research Assistant at Iowa State University (September 2019 – Present)*
  - Worked on the project about **Surface Similarity Evaluation**
  - Reasearch on **Machine Learning Applications on EHR data**
- *Internship at Chong Sing Holdings FinTech Group Limited (July 2017 - August 2017)*

SELECTED PROJECTS
=====
- *Similarity evaluation of 3D surface topography measurements project at Iowa State University (October 2019 – Present)*
  - Develop a complete framework for surface topography comparisons
  - Apply Frouier transformation to extract useful information of surface topography.
  - Evaluate the work with AUC and ROC
  
- *Filtered Historical Simulation applied in foreign exchange options (September 2015 - November 2016)*
  - Gathered related data from Bloomberg Terminal and Wind Terminal, matched the data by date and had the data cleaned, taking account of missing data and extreme data
  - Researched and applied Filtered Historical Simulation based on a variety of GARCH Model, to simulate value-at-risk (VaR) of foreign exchange options
  - Wrote programs based on MATLAB and EViews to do empirical analysis
      i) Fitted the implied volatility curve of the option using the Implied Volatility Function (IVF) Model to deal with missing data of implied volatility quoted by China Foreign Exchange Trade System
      ii) Predicted risk factors and then estimated VaR using an AGARCH Model, EGARCH Model, IGARCH Model and FIGARCH Model, respectively, as variance equations of the risk factor series, based on different hypotheses of the distribution of residuals (normal, t, skewed-t, GED and jump distribution)
  - Applied comparative analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the forecast of these combinations of models and hypotheses

  
SKILLS
======
- Proficient in Statistics & Math & Data structure & Computer Algorithm through academic coursework
- Skillful in using **R** & **Python** & **Java** programming
- Familiar with **Python**, **SQL**, **MATLAB** and **Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PPT)**
- Fluent in **Chinese** and **English** (written and verbal)
